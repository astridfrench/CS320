•	How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
My code is functional because I follow proper coding practices and code according to the project's requirements. I also use various testing methods, such as black box testing and unit testing.
My code is secure because I adhere to secure coding practices. For example, I use input validation to accept only specific inputs, which helps prevent injection attacks.

•	How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Understanding user requirements is important. Once we understand them, we can break down each requirement. For example, in my Contact.java code, the phone number must be a 10-digit number. Although the requirement doesn't specify it must be numeric, we know a phone number should only accept numbers to prevent incorrect input.
Testing the program ensures it follows the requirements and handles exceptions. Validating with users and asking for their feedback is also important to confirm the program aligns with their needs.

•	How do I approach designing software?
Understanding the requirements is the most important step before proceeding with other stages. Once the requirements are clear, planning and designing the software, coding, and testing can begin.
The testing phase is crucial because it ensures that all inputs going into the software are correct and can handle exceptions appropriately. Thorough testing helps catch potential issues early and ensures the software operates reliably under different scenarios
Incorporating user feedback during testing can help improve the program's functionality and user satisfaction. Keeping up with regular monitoring and maintenance ensures the software stays current and meets changing user needs and industry standards.
